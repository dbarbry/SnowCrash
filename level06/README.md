When we ls we found a php script and a file that execute the script with a file as argument.
We create a file in the /var/tmp directory and execute the script.
It works, the script print what we put in our txt file in /var/tmp/.
So now let's try to find how to execute "getflag".

First we tried to break `print` function in the script.
Did not work, so we saw this line :
$a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);
The /e execute a command, so we juste need to excecute our command this way ! 
So we tried [e  getflag], "[e  getflag]", [e  `getflag`] but these did not work.
We tried to use the exec command like this : [e  exec(getflag)], [e  exec(`getflag`)]
Then with some research we found that `$` could proabably help us.
We tried to understand how Php processes commands and strings.
With researches we found that the good syntax was : '[x {${exec(getflag)}}]', we just have to put this in /var/tmp/test02
When we execute the script with or file as parameter:
